# Welcome my freeCodeCamp Portfolio Project

This personal portfolio was built for freeCodeCamp's Certified Full Stack Developer Curriculum. You will find the actual lab under the CSS - Animations section. The specifications of the course required a Welcome Section and a Project Section, showcasing at least one project that I have built.
